# Ainsleigh's 24 Hour Theatre

## Introduction

Ainsleigh's 24Hour Theatre is a movie theatre booking program with two main functions. First, it allows users to book 
tickets to see a movie at 
the theatre. To make the program more realistic, customers are also able to view information about the movie
(listed below) and book multiple tickets. The second function is to allow staff to 
log in with a password. They are then able to add new movie showings at specific times. 
They can also remove showings.

**Information About Movies:**
- title
- rating according to Canada's motion picture rating system (G, PG, 14A, 18A, R)
- summary

## My Interest

The main motivator behind my interest in this project is the excitement I have about taking an idea from a few 
handwritten bullet points in my notebook to an actual working program. While I could do this with many types of projects
, I 
chose a movie booking program due to my enjoyment of going to the movies, and not being able to due to 
COVID-19 regulations. Furthermore, in planning this project, I was also interested in taking everything that I have 
learned in coding and using it, to both hone my skills and as a sort of landmark for how far I have come.
